# Mushroom-Classification

Using the Mushroom Dataset provided in the UCI Machine Learning repository, a Random Forest classifier was trained to classify
the edibility of the dataset's mushrooms; the two mushroom classifications were edible and poisonous. The final model was able
to correctly predict the edibility of all the mushrooms in the test set, which contained 2,031 observations; the achieved
accuracy score is valid since the test set was held out until the very end where the Random Forest classifier used it to
predict the edibility of those mushrooms.
