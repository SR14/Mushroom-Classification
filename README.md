# Mushroom Edibility

> Using the Mushroom Dataset provided in the UCI Machine Learning repository, a Random Forest classifier was trained to 
classify the edibility of the dataset's mushrooms; the mushrooms were classified as either edible or poisonous. The final 
model was able to correctly predict the edibility of all the mushrooms in the test set, which contained 2,031 observations; 
the achieved accuracy score is valid since the test set was held out until the very end where the Random Forest classifier 
used it to predict the edibility of those mushrooms. 

  The files in this repository include the first and second milestone reports, final report, presentation slides and the code
used for the completion of the project. The first milestone report focuses on the exploration and visualization phase, while 
the second milestone report focuses on the machine learning aspect; the final report is a compilation of the findings 
discussed in both milestone reports, and the presentation slides provide a concise format with which the project can be 
efficiently communicated. Finally, the jupyter notebook contains all the code used throughout the project; it contains the
preprocessing, exploration and visualization used on the mushroom dataset as well as the trained machine learning model.
